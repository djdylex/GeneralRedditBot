~ This text document allows you to write phrases for your bot to respond to + some extra cool stuff
~ Parameters determine when the phrase should be used and are put before the | symbol
~ The phrase is placed after.

~ For parameters: 
~ Inside the parameters you can use binary logic, this means you can write two seperate phrases in the parameters and put an or operator (which is a /), and if either one is true then the phrase can be chosen.  
~ For the parameters in the phrases between these slashes, 'AND' logic is used automatically
~ For example "chicken""bad"/"vegetables""good" will use the phrase if the parent comment contains chicken and bad or vegetables and good
~ Parameters syntax: 
~ '.' means the phrase can only be used in reply to an unread inbox comment or message (could be a reply to a comment posted by the bot)
~ '?' means the parent comment is a question
~ 'p' means the parent comment is personal, e.g the person is talking about themselves (words like i, i am etc.)
~ 'd' means the word is directed at a person (words like you, you're etc.), good when used with '?'
~ 's' means that the phrase will only be used if the parent comment actually has a subject in it. Most comments have a subject so this is pointless most of the time.
~ "" (quotations) allows you to search for words or phrases inside the parent comment (not case sensitive), e.g "he is fat" or "happy", the search method for the first is not the same as the second btw

~ Now for the in phrase formatting tags, which are placed inside square brackets [ ]:
~ [u] means the user's name, this is stripped of numbers that do not add to meaning, so this is not raw author name
~ [s] means the subject of the parent comment (doesn't work brilliantly).
~ You can phrases chosen from putting words in {} and seperating the choices with '/' - DO NOT PUT A CURLY BRACKET IN A CURLY BRACKET 
~ Lines that start with '~' are ignored and putting a '%' will stop the search through the document at that line (good for testing stuff)
