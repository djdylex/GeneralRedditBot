# GeneralRedditBot
So this bot goes around reddit trying to talk to people (but not in a smart way).
Just edit the responses to change what the bot says.

You must download both the subject_list and responses for this to work.

In order for this to work you must put in your own username and password in the script and also edit the subreddits variable list.
